Personal site built with React, Next.js and Material-UI.

## Description
This repo contains the source code for my personal site. Some notable features include:

* Next.js bundle analyzer support, which is enabled when the env var `ANALYZE` is true.
* Dependencies are monitored and kept up to date via Github's dependabot, and all commits are automatically deployed to Vercel.
